- **Mark as Completed**: Check the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed (strikethrough).
- **Delete All Tasks**: Clear the entire list by clicking the "Delete All" button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the application.
